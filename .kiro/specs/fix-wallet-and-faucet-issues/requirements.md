# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical issues in the MakeABet scaffold application where the wallet integration and faucet functionality are not working correctly. The system exhibits WalletContext errors when components try to access Solana wallet data, and the faucet endpoint returns 404 errors due to routing mismatches.

## Glossary

- **WalletContext**: React context provided by @solana/wallet-adapter-react that manages Solana wallet state
- **WalletProvider**: Component that wraps the application to provide wallet context to child components
- **Faucet Endpoint**: API route that distributes test tokens (ETH and PYUSD) on local development chains
- **Chain Type**: Either 'evm' or 'solana', determining which blockchain the application connects to
- **Proxy Configuration**: Vite configuration that routes API requests from the frontend to the backend server

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Wallet Context Availability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Solana wallet context to be available to all components regardless of the active chain, so that components don't crash with context errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Application renders, THE WalletProvider SHALL wrap all components with both EVM and Solana wallet contexts
2. WHEN A component uses Solana wallet hooks, THE WalletContext SHALL provide valid context values without throwing errors
3. WHEN THE active chain is EVM, THE Solana wallet hooks SHALL return null or undefined values gracefully without errors
4. WHEN THE active chain is Solana, THE Solana wallet hooks SHALL return valid wallet data

### Requirement 2: Fix Faucet API Routing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to request test tokens from the faucet, so that I can test the application with funded wallets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE user clicks the faucet button, THE frontend SHALL send a POST request to the correct API endpoint
2. WHEN THE API receives a faucet request at `/api/faucet`, THE server SHALL process the request and return tokens
3. WHEN THE Vite dev server receives requests to `/api/*`, THE proxy SHALL forward them to the backend API server
4. WHEN THE faucet request succeeds, THE response SHALL include transaction hashes for both ETH and PYUSD transfers

### Requirement 3: Improve Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when something goes wrong, so that I understand what happened and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE faucet request fails, THE application SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN THE wallet is not connected, THE faucet button SHALL be disabled with appropriate messaging
3. WHEN THE rate limit is exceeded, THE error message SHALL indicate how long to wait
4. WHEN THE API is unavailable, THE error message SHALL indicate a connection problem
